# Tweet_Sentiment_Analyzer
 _____
Tweet_Sentiment_Analyzer analyses the overall sentiment of tweet using the 
NLTK library, assigning each tweet a "score" and graphing each tweet based on this score. 
Additionally, the application also allows the use of keyword filters that
will result in only tweets including the keyword to be graphed.
